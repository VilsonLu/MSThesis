# Welcome to my thesis

I am currently taking up my MS in Computer Science in De La Salle University (Philippines).

Thesis: Can we use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to forecast time-series (trajectories)?

So, this is where I keep my proof-of-concepts, implementations and etc. for my thesis. Currently I am writing my thesis proposal so my repo is a little cluttered right now.

Technology:
1. C# 
2. ASP.NET MVC
3. AngularJS
4. D3.js
5. Possibly (Node.Js)

But, I am still open to use any other tools.

Progress:
- Implemented SOM
- Visualize SOM
- Implemented Labelling
